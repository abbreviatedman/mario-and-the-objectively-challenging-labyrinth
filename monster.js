// Make a function called `newMonster` that takes in a number and returns a new object with:
// * a `hitPoints` property set to a number of your choice
// * a minimum attack based in some way on the number that gets passed in, and
// * a maximum attack that's based on the that as well (but bigger than the minimum attack.)

// The idea here is that we can get back a monster with a certain "level" that's based on what we pass in, and we can set a minimum and maximum attack to randomize things within a certain range.
